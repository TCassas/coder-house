# Tengu Store üë∫üìö
Final project for the React course ran by CoderHouse üíª

## Idea
___
Manga e-commerce with auth, cart persistance, stock control, responsive design, dynamic/conditional, forms, simple animations and some other things üêä

I choose "Tengu Store" as the name of my e-commerce, and mangas as the main products of the  page because of my passion for japanese culture.

**What is a [tengu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengu)?**

## Setup
___
Execute the following commands in your terminal
```
git clone https://github.com/TCassas/coder-house.git
cd coder-house
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm start
```
This will boot up the react application on port 3000.

**Notes:**
- After the evaluation of this project, you would have to provide your own Firebase credentials in the .env file, just follow the .env.example.
- The img property in the products collection correlates to a file inside the folder /public/imgs/
